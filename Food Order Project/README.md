## üõ†Ô∏è Steps Performed

### 1. Import Libraries
- Imported essential Python libraries: `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, and `Seaborn`.

### 2. Load Dataset
- Loaded the dataset: `food_orders_new_delhi (1).csv`.

### 3. Data Cleaning
- Displayed the first and last 5 rows using `df.head()` and `df.tail()`.
- Generated statistical summaries using `df.describe()`.
- Inspected data types and checked for missing or duplicated values.
- Handled missing values in the `Discounts and Offers` column by replacing `NaN` with `"None"`.
- Verified the dataset was clean with no null values remaining.

### 4. Data Visualization and Insights

1. Question : How does the average delivery duration vary over time? 
   Approach : Line plot 
   Insight : Delivery duration fluctuates between January , 2024, and February 5, 2024. 

 2. Question : What are the percentage shares of each payment method? 
    Approach : Pie chart 
    Insight : Cash on Delivery (35.70%), Credit Card (33.70%), Digital Wallet (30.60%). 

 3. Question : Which order value range has the highest frequency? 
    Approach : Histogram 
    Insight : Orders around 000 value are the most frequent. 

 4. Question : How do order values differ across discount categories? 
    Approach : Scatter plot 
    Insight : Discounts show varied impacts on order values. 

 5. Question : How do discounts vary across payment methods? 
    Approach : Violin plot 
    Insight : Different patterns observed for different payment methods. 

 6. Question : What is the refund/chargeback distribution among payment methods? 
    Approach : Pie chart 
    Insight : Refunds/chargebacks distributed similarly to payment method shares. 

 7. Question : How are commission fees correlated to payment processing fees? 
    Approach : Scatter plot 
    Insight : Positive correlation observed. 

 8. Question : Which discount type has the highest percentage? 
    Approach : Pie chart 
    Insight : 0% Discount was the most common (23.3%). 

 9. Question : How does delivery fee vary relative to order value? 
    Approach : Scatter plot 
    Insight : Delivery fees are fixed at intervals (0, 20, 30, 40, 50). 

 10. Question : Which payment method is most common? 
     Approach : Bar chart 
     Insight : Cash on Delivery is the most popular. 

 11. Question : Which discount has the highest user count? 
     Approach : Bar chart 
     Insight : 0% discount had the most users.
